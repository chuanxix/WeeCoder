This is the iOS development project for my practicum. It's built in XCode 7.3.1 and Swift 2.2. This app can run on universal iOS devices.

The first view of the app shows the name of the app and three buttons leading to three other views. The first view is built in the interface builder. The three other views are all built programmatically, except for the unwind segues.

The Resources folder contains all the audio and graphic resources I used for this app. I created some of the images and took other resources from the Internet under the Creative Commons License, mostly pixabay.com and freesound.org.
